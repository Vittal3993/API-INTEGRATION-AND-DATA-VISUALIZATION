Company : Codetech IT solutions

Name : Vittal Mallikarjun Mugali

Intern ID : CT06DY1012

Domain : Python Programming

Duration : 6 weeks

Mentor : Neela santosh


Description of the project :
This project focuses on integrating public APIs with Python to fetch real-time data and visualize it using Matplotlib. The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in API consumption, data parsing, and graphical representation of dynamic datasets.

Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the project retrieves 5-day weather forecasts for a specified city. The data is processed to extract temperature trends over time and visualized using line plots. This helps in understanding temporal patterns and enhances decision-making through visual insights.

Key Technologies : 

Python: Core scripting and data handling

Requests: For API communication

Matplotlib: For data visualization

OpenWeatherMap API: Source of real-time weather data

Learning Outcomes : 

Hands-on experience with RESTful API integration

Data extraction and transformation using Python

Building clean and readable visualizations

Error handling and debugging real-world API responses
